## Startup Internships, University Internships, Unpaid Internships, Dissemination

I started my internship journey through an unpaid university research internship. These are available in research labs in your home university and professors will be happy to work with motivated students. Some people think research might not be for them but for an undergrad intern, most of the work is actually in development so it is fully applicable to for your work experience section in your resume. 

This section will cover how to apply to unconventional internships. I cover this lesson but some of these internships may be more valuable than a standard company internship. For my first internship, I worked with Dr. Sean Luke of GMU which helped me get into a paid internship at Carnegie Mellon University next summer.

My notes:
    - most of these roles are never advertised
      - They don't have time to advertise
      - Interest and knowledge about the startup is worth a lot here.
      - https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?companyHqGeo=%5B%22105284588%22%5D&companySize=%5B%22B%22%2C%22C%22%2C%22D%22%5D&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=P6F 
    - LInkedin has a proximity filter to search for closeby startups

Steps:
    - Go to linkedin, and search for startups near your house
    - Then read about these startups and find a few that you really vibe with
    - Go to people page and find a few alums or people who you have connections with
    - Then reach out to those people with a message of interest.
