## Career Fairs

These are great to practice your social skills and meet with real engineers. Again the goal of networking is to build a relationship. If you see someone in person it's 100% better than getting a linkedin message. 

Prioritize engineers at the career fair. Take a resume with you and have them review it on the spot. Edit with their changes then send them a thank you note after with final resume and ask for a referral. Ask recruiters if there are any engineers at the booth that you can talk with. 

### Talk about whatever you want
I know career proffessionals at universities make this encounter into an algorithm with the memorized 40 second elevator pitch and give your resume but most of those people wont get a call back. What you need is to be remembered after the short chat. Once you get through with the initial spiel you can talk about anything to build a good connection (be respectful).

Ask them how they found the city (they are probably traveling). Recommend a place to visit. How they found their job. Is their team growing, what was the most exciting thing they worked on last year... 

### Other tips
Go there early so the recruiters and engineers aren't tired and before the lines form. 

Go there with an open mind, try not to have too many preferences for the recruiters and engineers. I made this mistake with Amazon Prime in 2014 when I told them I specifically wanted a SLAM/CV role but I could've probably gone in with an EE role that in a year would transition to a research team... 

Try to add everyone you meet at the event on lnkedin and send a thank you email. 

If they give you a business card send a thank you email.
