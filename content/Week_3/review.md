## Review

What did we do so far?

Week 1:
- Resume: Spent minimal time and made sure we had a few projects hyperlinked to github. 
- Linkedin: Made sure we have a presence. 
- Strategy: We want to be realistic about where we apply. If this is your first internship and you don't have deployed hobby projects you want to spend more time on safe companies or university research labs.

Week 2: 
- Interview/Leetcode preparation strategy: Learn the patterns through the Designgurus course and master the 75 neetcode questions. 


These two weeks are actually enough for you to apply and pass the tech interview.
