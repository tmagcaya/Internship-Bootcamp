## Leetcode ++

Mastery at Leetcode requires interview practice, daily coding, company specific practice. 

1. Interview practice: 
   1. You'll want to interview as much as possible to get comfortable with the interview process. Mock interviews here with a few friends will be invaluable. Even for me after many offers, I generally need a few mock interviews before I feel comfortable.
   2. For internships you won't get as many chances to practice in real interviews so I recommend doing actual mock interviews with ChatGPT and with a friend. 
2. Daily coding:
   1. Nuff said
3. Company Specific Practice:
   1. Leetcode Premium will have company specific questions that you can practice ahead of time. 
   2. If you're prepping with a group (like a internship bootcamp cohort wink wink) you'll probably get interviews at similar places, you can share notes
   3. Leetcode, Glassdoor, Blind will have other people discussing company interview questions. 
   4. Working through these questions will make sure you are prepared to the max
