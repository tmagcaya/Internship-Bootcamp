## Email Reachouts

I know I said effective networking but yes after social media, your best bet is still cold emails. The goal here is to get through to the person, develop your relationship to ask for a referral. Btw, if you have a phone number and you feel close to the person (family friend) go ahead and write a respectful text message that would be better. 

**Take that shot!** A facebook recruiter told me that out of 200 applicants only 20 of them ever send an email to ask for a referral and for junior roles the referrals will probably get the job.


### Who to write to
Start with family friends and past professors. Thank them for their support in the past and for professors mention a topic you really appreciated learning in their class. Ask them if they know if anyone is hiring a summer intern next summer or during the year. They probably get a ton of emails from companies so if you're on their radar they will forward you an email and get their referral.

Then reach out to people on linkedin through their email addresses. Most companies have standard email formats like firstname.lastname@companyname.com. Mention something about their post or previous posts in your email. 

You can use the above method for a hiring manager who posts a job posting as well.



### What to write
Please see previous post on what to write. 

**Be professonal in all communications! Read your messages twice before sending!** The worst thing is to spend all this time and come off as unprofessional or disrespectful.
