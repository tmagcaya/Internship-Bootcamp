## Startup Internships, University Internships, Unpaid Internships, Dissemination

This lesson will be covered through zoom.  

My notes:
    - most of these roles are never advertised
      - They don't have time to advertise
      - Interest and knowledge about the startup is worth a lot here.
      - https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?companyHqGeo=%5B%22105284588%22%5D&companySize=%5B%22B%22%2C%22C%22%2C%22D%22%5D&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=P6F 
    - LInkedin has a proximity filter to search for closeby startups
    - Schools have incubators
    - post on linkedin and have a website (github Hugo templates)
Steps:
    - Go to linkedin, and search for startups near your house
    - Then read about these startups and find a few that you really vibe with
    - Go to people page and find a few alums or people who you have connections with
    - Then reach out to those people with a message of interest.
