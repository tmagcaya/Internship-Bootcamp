## Portfolio Projects

Past projects will come up multiple times during your interviews. This is your opportunity to show your depth and talk about some of the interesting things you learned during your projects. 

The interviewer questions will vary but what they want to hear stays the same. In this section we will cover strategies for success in this interview type.

### What the interviewer wants to hear (Rubric) 
- Initiative and Motivation: Did you find the past project by asking professors, did you come up with a side project, did you lead a group project and take it above and beyond?
- Show evidence of learning by yourself: Find a piece of a past project where you found a new way to learn. Maybe you visited office hours more often. 
- Show how you evaluated project options quickly before deciding on the project.
- Have you used AI to speed up you work? Wrote test cases, Reveiwed code, Understood existing code and documents. 
- Have you used AI or ML in a project?

### What if I don't have much to talk about?

As mentioned in the resume section in Week 1, you're still in school and companies aren't expecting you to have coded a deployed website with customers. Class/hobby projects are great to talk about. Just make sure to remember the details and mention the project from beginning to end. You'd be surprised how much information you can share about a small project (design, exploration, learning, testing, friend feedback).

### My projects don't deserve attention :/
Your potential and story deserves attention and those companies need AI native developers.
