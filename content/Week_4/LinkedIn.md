## LinkedIn and Twitter (X)

The goal here is to find people who you want to be like when you grow up, and ask them for advice. Social media is the easiest way to connect.

### Stay connected with the community and get to know the wizards
Most professionals keep a LinkedIn, Twitter or BlueSky profile depending on the community's preference. Follow them and stay connected with the community. 

For example in AI, most of the wizards will have LinkedIn account but will use Twitter more often. The ones who are more experienced will write on substack and the very best (wizards) will appear on youtube videos and podcasts. 

Youtube is in general the easiest way to stay connected with the community and wizards but those people won't have time to respond to you. I'd still recommend connecting with your heros on linkedin or twitter for sure but use your time carefully.

### Who to add on LinknedIn
>Friend of a friend is a friend.

Start by connecting with every professional/friend/family-friend you met at some point. Then connect with people who you want to be like when you grow up. Send a connection request and follow them to be able to message them later. 

As a new engineer you want to take all the shots you can get. Send as many connection requests as possible and let the algorithm do the magic of showing your friends of friends. 

### Who to write a short intro message
Linkedin gives you 5 intro messages per month. Use them for people who you really want to get connected with. Your neighbor and classmates will surely add you. Use these for industry professions who could really refer you for an internsip role.

**Be professonal in all communications! Read your messages twice before sending!** The worst thing is to spend all this time and come off as unprofessional or disrespectful.

There are many ways to get on the radar for someone. The easiest is to ask a quick resume/project review. If your resume is mostly ready I'd recommend asking for a project review with a github link or a deployed website. You want to make sure that once they open that demo, they will see good effort. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something that you worked on and cared for.

If someone recommended for you to meet that person, make sure to mention that in your message. Following this line, ask your current connections who you can connect with next to ask for referrals so you can reach out to the next person this way.

Be creative in your reachouts. Use your affinity, chatgpt. Continute to reach out for 2 times if they dont respond. They may be busy but they won't dislike it if you reach out again. They may even appreciate your motivation and enthusiasm. 

The eventual goal is to be able to ask for a refererral and better yet for them to forward your resume to the hiring manager.
