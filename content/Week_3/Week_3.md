## Week 3: Motivation and Portfolio 

With the last two weeks you now have a workable resume and a leetcode prep schedule. As you prepare for your online assessments I want to take a slower week to review some important lessons, help improve your motivation and give tips on portfolio projects.

I'd recommend dividing your time by 3 parts for the following weeks:

### Reading:
- [Review](review.md)
- [Motivation](motivation.md)
- [Portfolio Projects](portfolio.md)
- [Being AI Native](AInative.md)

### Assignments:
1. Bonus points if you can find an open source project to contribute to for next week's session
2. Do the weekly requirements:
   1. 20 internship applications <-- Focus on this as early applicants get preference
   2. 7 Leetcode questions
   3. 10 networking outreach messages
   4. Attendance at weekly sessions (Sundays at 10am PT)
