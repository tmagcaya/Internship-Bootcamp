## Week 4: Networking 
> -Many positions are filled before they are posted 
> -80% of all jobs are found through networking personal connections

The two statements above are related and mutually beneficial. I was paid $5,000 for a referral I made at Facebook. It's easier and safer for companies to hire referrals and they incentivize with these bonuses. Before the budget for a new position gets approved, teams internally identify the need and job description. The search for the right candidate starts ~6 months before the role does. If you're on the radar, you will sometimes get selected for the interviews before applying.

The goal of networking for you is to connect with professionals and strengthen that relationship to finally be able to ask for the person to get their referral and to forward your resume to the hiring manager with a small note. 

--- That sounded really materialistic I know... Everyone is so busy these days and I know you undergrads are on a rush and dont have time to actually build a proper friendship with someone and then to ask for a referral. It's ok to stretch times here but then starting early will make this feel less materialistic. You're essentially making more friends through this process and learning more about life. Enjoy the process and be respectful please!

This week we will cover how to get on that radar through effective networking.
