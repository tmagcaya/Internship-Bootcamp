## Startup Internships, University Internships, Unpaid Internships, Dissemination

This lesson will be covered through zoom.  

My notes:
    - most of these roles are never advertised
      - They don't have time to advertise
      - Interest and knowledge about the startup is worth a lot here. 
    - LInkedin has a proximity filter to search for closeby startups
    - Schools have incubators
    - post on linkedin and have a website (github Hugo templates)
