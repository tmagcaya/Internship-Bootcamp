## Motivation

Motivation is a force multiplier. 

### Long term motivation
Fill in the blank: Show me your ______ and I will tell you who you are
- friends 
- follower list 
- youtube/spotify history
- search history
- shopping cart
- who you are out with
- location history
- like history
- what makes you put your phone down

For long term motivation we need to think deeply about the list above. They effect your energy, motivation, intentions and subconcious. These are things we can control and change to improve our long term motivation and reach our dreams. 

The first step is to be aware of what effects your long term motivation, the second is to control it. 

The ordering of the above list can be different for you. For me who I am around directly effects my motivation. I remember starting my CMU internship and being amazed at the quality of friends I made that summer. My project there was also cool but I probably benefited more from my friendships and things I learned from fellow interns than anything.

### Short term motivation
- Stacking up small wins in a topic
- Eat your frogs for breakfast (do the most important thing that you've been avoiding in the morning)
- 25 minute focus sessions followed by a different activity (avoid burnout)
- Count your sessions per day
- Use Google calendar!

### Word about distractions
These may vary but basically the goal here is to reduce your discractions over time and focus on finishing your education with multiple internships. I paused most gaming except with high quality friends until after PhD.

- Digital short term energy hits

### Bonus Points: Talk to more people
My neighbor of 4 years had been living alone after a divorce. We visited him our first month in the neighborhood and gave him a pandemic care pack with a introduction post card. I visited him a few times during 4 years but didn't get to know him as I didn't want to cross any boundaries. I probably could've got to know him more if I tried harder and annoyed him a little but I chose comfort instead. Most other neighbors had families but this guy was alone. He recently passed away at a young age due to cancer. On his mantle was my post card message.
