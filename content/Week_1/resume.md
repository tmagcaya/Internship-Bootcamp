## Resume Guide for College Students

The goal here is to revise your resume and make it super accessible to someone who only has 30 seconds to look at your resume. This means having a good format and placing hyperlinks for them to learn more. 

### Most Important
Add in hyperlinks anywhere possible. **Every project needs a GitHub/Report link** + deployed demo if you have it. 
   1. If you have a past internship and have a report, place it on google drive and hyperlink the report. For class projects, place the code on github and link on your resume. Don't think too much about polishing these for now. Just have them available and you will polish later. 

### Resume Layout

1. Single column layout with no graphics. Keep things simple with heading, sub-headings and bullet points. Template/style is less important but if you need something here is a template: 
2. **Recommended section order:** 
   1. **Education:** List relevant classes like python, java, ML, Data Structures and Algorithms
   2. **Experience:** Past internships, part-time technical work, extracurricular hobby projects and class projects
      1. ***Project Format:*** Project Name | Tech Stack | [GitHub Link] | [Live Demo Link]
      2. Organize bullet points as: Problem → Solution → Impact with numbers
"Built X using Y, resulting in Z% improvement"
   3. **Work experience:** This is where you put panera, safeway etc. Only add a single experience
   4. **Skills:** Add all applicable skills that you see on the job description. Break into groups, Languages, Frameworks, Tools...
      1. Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
Frameworks: React, Node.js, Django
Tools: Git, Docker, AWS
   5. **Extracurricular/Volunteer/Leadership Awards**.
1. If you have olympiad wins in CS or Math, put these at the very top of your resume.
2. **ATS Essentials**
   1. Submit as .PDF
   2. Mirror their keywords
   3. Match their tech stack: Include the exact technologies they mention if applicable

### Other recommendations:
- **One page only:** Recruiters want to see that you can prioritize and keep content to one page.
- **Include GPA if 3.5+**
- **No objectives section:** When you apply to a position it's clear that your objective is to get that job, don't waste the space and put your recruiter to sleep with a paragraph at the top.
- **Class projects and hobby projects even small ones:** You're looking for your first internship and it's expected that you don't have a past internship experience to add in your resume. You need to add all of your hobby/class projects. Think back to when you took your first CS class and add your projects and code into the resume. This holds especially true if you have only taken a few classes and have not yet done an internship. These are foundational projects and hiring managers love to hear about your learning experiences.
