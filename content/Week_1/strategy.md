## Application Strategy

"No matter how successful people may look on LinkedIn, there was a time in their life when they didn't have any experience"

You have limited time to apply, so strategizing your applications between reach and safe internships will be important. If you don't have a past CS class, applying to Microsoft as a SW Intern will almost certainly be a waste of time. 
- Reach/Safe internships:
  - 70/30 if you have deployed projects or youtube videos
  - 50/50 if you have past class/hobby projects  
  - 30/70 if you only have class projects
  - University research lab internships if you don't have past class experience
> Reach means MAANG-Big7 companies like NVIDIA, Google, Meta, Microsoft etc or Unicorn startups funded by YC or big VCs
> 
> Safe means smaller companies who are looking for cheaper software interns for their expensive IT needs

### How do I know where the balance is for me? 
- A lot of factors will impact your strategy such as the current economy (not good), labor needs (not good), your past experience. Reach out to your mentors to ask about how you should divide your application time based on your background.
- Regardless of where you end up try to do a small project in (or tie your main project to) AI. This is the time to get on the AI wagon. If you do a sub project in AI you can list that on your resume and next year get into an AI internship!
- This is a marathon, you'll start these internships at somewhere and then grow to get a job at the big players as you build experience.
- A cheat code anyone can use: Look at the above strategy list again. If you have class projects then complete a hobby project. If you already have that then make a youtube video demoing the project. You can do these as you are applying to internships. 
- It doesn't matter where you do your first internship. It matters what you do there and what you learn. 

### Take core classes early to qualify for more internships
- 400 level classes teach you engineering concepts. 
- As an example if you take Python and Jave in your first semester, you can add that to your resume. 

### What do you want to be when you grow up? - Work in progress
It's cliche but has a deeper side. 
What do you want to be when you grow up may mean:
- What would you want to do in life and if you don't do this you would regret it?

1. If you wanted experience from life and minimal work
2. If you wanted fame
3. If you wanted money


Another side to this is how you percieve the world:
- If you think we only have 5 years before AGI, then you can probably prioritize finishing school early.
