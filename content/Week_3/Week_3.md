## Week 3: Motivation and Portfolio 

With the last two weeks you now have a workable resume and a leetcode prep schedule. As you prepare for your online assessments, I want to take a slower week to review some important lessons, help improve your motivation and give tips on portfolio projects.

### Reading:
- [Review](review.md)
- [Motivation](motivation.md)
- [Portfolio Projects](portfolio.md)
- [Being AI Native](AInative.md)

### Assignments:
1. Bonus points if you can find 10 people to reach out to by next week.
2. Do the weekly requirements:
   1. 20 internship applications <-- Focus on this as early applicants get preference
   2. 7 Leetcode questions
   3. 10 networking outreach messages
   4. Attendance at weekly sessions (Sundays at 10am PT)
