## Leetcode

Leetcode has over 4k questions. Instead of attempting questions at random, I recommend the order below:
- [Leetcode question patterns:](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview)
  - Taking this course helped me approach leetcode questions with a toolset. Once you learn these patterns you can use these on all of the 4k leetcode questions. I would recommend buying the class so in the future you can get back to this and learn the patterns again. 
  - This is a really effective way to use your study hours, highly recommended!
- [Blind 75 Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75)
  - Some OG released the most asked 75 questions. I can confirm most of my interviews asked exact questions from this list. 
  - Neetcode has youtube videos on these, I'd recommend attempting them first then watching the videos. 
  - Bingewatch these a day before your interview. 

### Prep Recommendations
- Practice as if you're in an interview:
  - Time yourself to 30 mins
  - Start with a simple test case to make sure your understand the question
  - Attempt a simple solution
  - Attempt to make it better
  - Write down the time and space complexity
  - Submit your answer and iterate
  - **No phones, no tabs, just attempt the question and give yourself time to grok**
- If you can't find the solution, watch the video solutions, see discussion but don't just copy and paste the answer, leave the leetcode question as just attempted you'll come back to it later. 
- Being comfortable with interviewing is soo important. You'll be 100x more correct in your answers if you are comfortable with being interviewed. 
  - more on this in leetcode++ section
- No need to buy Leetcode premium, find a friend who has it instead to get the company specific questions
- Interviewers love to see you think about constraints, edge cases and ask about 
  
### Other notes:

1. Time complexity > Space complexity 
   1. Most companies prioritize speed of service, so after solving a good solution talk about how you can improve time complexity at the expense of memory complexity. 
   2. You can buy extra ram and use more space complexity to improve time complexity
