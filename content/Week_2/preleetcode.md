## Leetcode Prerequisites 

> Prerequisite Data Structures and Algorithms, if you have taken this class continue to next lesson.

Before diving into leetcode questions let's make sure you have the prerequisites. Leetcode questions come from Data Structures and Algorithm's classes. If you're in the beginning of your career, you'll want to take these classes early on and do really well (memorize the book). 

If you haven't taken the class yet, learn the basics with the links below. You want to learn a lesson then attempt it's coding questions afterward so you can internalize the knowledge. You will want to use your study time effectively with visualizations of the algorithms. I have a good list to follow and learn if you haven't taken these classes before. 

**Prerequisites:**
- Programming class (Python recommended)
  - Online class: 
- Data Structures and Algorithm's Class
  - or


**Recommended workflow:**
- Learn about the first topic (arrays)
- Then take a few easy leetcode questions about the topic
- After attempting it watch the video solutions (don't enter the answers on leetcode once you learn about the answers, this isn't a class). Leave the leetcode questions that you haven't solved yourself as attempted. You'll come back to them and attempt them later. 
- Repeat from 1 with the next lesson in the Data Structures and Algos class
