### 📊 Testimonials

"I secured my first research opportunity thanks to the bootcamp. The weekly sessions and mentorship were extremely practical, everything from resume feedback to interview preparation gave me the confidence to stand out. Talha’s personal advice and care for his students made a huge difference in helping me prepare and understand what recruiters are really looking for. I walked into my internship interviews feeling prepared and walked out with an offer. As a student early in my career, this experience was invaluable and I’m really grateful for the support."

"Offer from TAMU-CC AgTech REU. The experience was absolutely amazing, there was never a week or session I felt was being wasted. With the bootcamp having plenty of industry mentors and experts come in to provide resources alongside Talha, I was always excited to see who I can connect with and take the next step in my career with each and every week. Talha's own experience with REU's gave a niche personal touch that is hard to find elsewhere. His expertise was incredibly invaluable, sitting with me for up to an hour prepping for my interview 1-on-1 prior to my offer. I don't know if I would have secured the offer without him. Overall, I loved the program and am very thankful for my internship opportunity from this bootcamp, especially as a freshman with no prior internships."

"I loved my summer research experience. My offer was from the University of Michigan at Dearborn, and the research was math and computer science heavy. Not only was my summer super productive and enriching, but I made some great memories. The combination of learning and spending time with like-minded individuals, under the guidance of such smart mentors was amazing. I'd like to thank Talha for all of his efforts, because truly I wouldn't have gotten this experience without him."

"Talha did very well with advising what steps to take during which stage of the job search process. I recommend this bootcamp and indeed I myself was a cohort for two seasons! There is too much to lose in not attending this program!"

"I am in the final round of the hiring process with great tech startup. To be honest, this camp gave me so much insights into the hiring process, so that I was able to land this internship bypassing whole recruiting process. I literally became a top candidate for the role despite competing with applicants from the TOP schools and Ivy League, with much less work experience. I loved that we were able to talk to Company Managers with a lot of experience. Essentially, the advice that you gave us actually played out in my favor to get this internship."

"I have received an offer from Wells Fargo. Over the past year, I have applied to almost 2k places for internships. Talha helped me with resume reviews and I had the chance to get referrals from the guests he brought. The key things that helped me 
during my internship search were: 1. Having a decent resume, 2. Applying early, 3. Focusing on leetcode."
