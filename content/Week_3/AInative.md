## Being AI Native

One of the reasons why companies are hiring students is because they are AI native. They use AI in everything they do and they are more efficient with it. Make sure to know about AI systems like Cursor, NotebookLM, ChatGPT etc. Whenever possible during the interviews talk about how you use AI tools to make yourself more efficient. 

Here is my strategy for signaling this in an interview:
1. Talk about 1-2 projects where you've completed the project and you can go in depth. Try not to mention AI in these projects
2. Then in a third project mention a project with a deadline (you can also do this as a challenge in a weekend) and talk about how you've tested the limits of AI tools like cursor or claude code to see how fast you can go from idea to deployment.
